      <h1>Welcome to Make Noise Hull!</h1>
      <p>
        Make Noise is a non-profit Warren Youth Project initiative and
        collective ran by a group of young women, created as a response to
        issues the group had experienced or heard were happening in the Hull
        music scene pertaining to a lack of visibility for women in the
        industry, and to the harassment and assault experienced by women in
        local venues during events. We feel that gigs should be a positive
        experience for everybody. <br /><br />
        We began meeting and discussing these ideas in October 2017. We felt it
        was important to hear other women's experiences with sexual harassment
        and assault at musical events, belittlement in entering the music
        industry, and the level of encouragement they feel they were given as a
        woman to work in the music industry or as a musician. We wanted to
        create a dialogue and make sure women's opinions were being heard,
        respected and considered, before we made our next steps.
        <br /><br />
        We launched in January 2018 - announcing an Open Meeting for women and
        non binary people. Over forty women attended our Open Meeting and we had
        industry professionals, music staff from local colleges, young musicians
        who haven't been able to progress in their local scene, musicians who
        had been facing these issues for over fifty years, and young women who
        simply had issues when attending local gigs.
        <br /><br />
        We centred our future work around the suggestions we received at this
        event and work with local venues and artists as a positive force to
        change the face of Hull's creative scene!

      <h2><em>What we've done so far</em></h2>
      <p><strong>Workshops;</strong> Since 2018 we have facilitated or organised workshops in Songwriting, Music Production, Zine-Making, Guitar Pedals, and DJing. We currently have members able to teach people Songwriting and DJing.</p>
      <p><strong>Gigs;</strong> We have put on many of our own gigs spotlighting local and national (usually northern) femme talent and curated gigs and day festivals at venues such as The New Adelphi Club, The Polar Bear, Warren Record Store and more.</p>
      <p><strong>Partnership events;</strong> Alongside our own gigs we have volunteered our services or helped local venues find femme talent for events such as Humber Street Sesh, Fast and Bulbous Festival, Freedom Festival and more.</p>
      <p><strong>Consultations;</strong> We have worked closely over the years with The Polar Bear and Dive HU5 to help them develop a safer, more respectful space for their patrons.</p>
